This is project I was able to develop for the first challenge of Hiring Coders. It's main objective was to create a promotion page where you could subscribe your e-mails to receive sales information. In my paricular case, I decided to do a website for sales of household appliances. Something nworth noting is that the site is developed in portuguese.

Unfortunately, I lost myself in my organization and time management the week before the project's delivery state. Therefore, its developement is very basic (and kinda of ugly as well) in order to deliver it in time. Moreover, I'm planning to upgrade it over time.
